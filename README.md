This code is made during Melbourne Facebook Hackathon 2017

Short Description: 1/4 Australians will experience depression in their lifetime. Mental health is one of the biggest health concerns of our generation. Psychologists have been successful in using music as therapy for conditions such as depression, anxiety and anger management issues. 

At Muse we combine camera feed analysis and facial recognition algorithms to identify user moods as a means of providing the next generation of music therapy...right at your fingertips.

# Future Stage:
- Upgrade the music storage, we just make enough for demonstration.
- We will make the app running  at the background, it may help to detect the anxiety, depression or suicidal, that may trigger the call to suicide help-line or the relative as well as provide soft music.
- Improve the mood detection

# We would like to futher improve the code after the Hackathon but due to other commitments of each team member. The app development is now stopped.

# The code is own by:
- Dinh Phuc Ngoc
- Japneet Singh
- Sumudu Sameera Perera
- Vlad Litvinenko
